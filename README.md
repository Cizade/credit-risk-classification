# credit-risk-classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to assess credit risk based on financial data. The goal is to help financial institutions make informed lending decisions by predicting whether a loan is likely to default. Using logistic regression, the analysis aims to classify loans as either healthy or high-risk, enabling better risk management and more strategic financial planning. All code was written by myself and troubleshooting and assistance was provided by ChatGPT.
